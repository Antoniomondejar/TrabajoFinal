abstract="In this paper, we propose a single-agent modal logic framework for reasoning about goal-direct ``knowing how'' based on ideas from linguistics, philosophy, modal logic and automated planning. We first define a modal language to express ``I know how to guarantee ϕ given $\psi$'' with a semantics not based on standard epistemic models but labelled transition systems that represent the agent's knowledge of his own abilities. A sound and complete proof system is given to capture the valid reasoning patterns about ``knowing how'' where the most important axiom suggests its compositional nature.",

abstract = {We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability problem for a modal logic expressing ‘knowing how’ assertions, related to an agent’s abilities to achieve a certain goal. We take one of the most standard semantics for this kind of logics based on linear plans. Our main result is a proof that checking satisfiability of a ‘knowing how’ formula can be done in Σ2P. The algorithm we present relies on eliminating nested modalities in a formula, and then performing multiple calls to a satisfiability checking oracle for propositional logic.},

abstract = {Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in general, communicate repeatedly with its environment, its meaning cannot be presented naturally as an input/output function (as is often done in the denotational approach to semantics). In this paper, an alternative is put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all observers; then two program parts are said to be observation congruent if they are, in all program contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part, that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation congruence class.The paper demonstrates, for a sequence of simple languages expressing finite (terminating) behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic language described here becomes a calculus for writing and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their properties.},

abstract = {We present an efficient algorithm for bisimulation equivalence. Generally, bisimulation equivalence can be tested in O(mn) for a labeled transition system with m transitions and n states. In order to come up with a more efficient algorithm, we establish a relationship between bisimulation equivalence and the relational coarsest partition problem, solved by Paige and Tarjan in O(m log n) time. Given an initial partition and a binary relation, the problem is to find the coarsest partition compatible with them. Computing bisimulation equivalence can be viewed both as an instance and as a generalization of this problem: an instance, because only the universal partition is considered as an initial partition and a generalization since we want to find a partition compatible with a family of binary relations instead of one single binary relation. We describe how we have adapted the Paige-Tarjan algorithm of complexity O(m log n) to minimize labeled transition systems modulo bisimulation equivalence. This algorithm has been implemented in C and is used in Aldébaran, a tool for the verification of concurrent systems.}
